  <p>Growing up in the slums made me realise just how problematic gabbage is.
    Many are times we have seen several companies come up with ways of curbing this issue with no much success, in that, they end up collecting gabbage in one place,
     just to dump in another. After much consultation with some of my friends, we had an idea that would reduce, if not end, this great issue in Kenya.
  </p>
  <h2>Whats unique about us:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are motivated in our plan to make our environment a abetter place.</li>
    <li>We try to come up with seminers that teach our community a away of separating gabbage so that its easier for us to recycle.</li>
    <li>We as linda mazingira provide four bins labled plastic,glass,papaer and one for foodstuffs that will later be turned to manure for our makeshift vegetable garden.</li>
    <li>We realise that to some street families,this is a gabbage is a source of income and thats why we have employed some of them willing to work.</li>
    <p>Below is some photos of our well labeled bins.</p>

  <p>We started a small gabbage collection and recycling company that not only seeks to rid our country of all its waste, but also creates awareness and employment in the process.</p>
  <h3>This is where we are at the moment:</h3>

  <p>All these gabbage is not only killing our marinelife and wildlife, but it's also slowly wiping out the human race, what with all the floods and draught experinced due to global warming.</p>
  <p>Change is a matter of mindset and perception and it can only start with us. We, will decide where our future generation will get to live.</p>
